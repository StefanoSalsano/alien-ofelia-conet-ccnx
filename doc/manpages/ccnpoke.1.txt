NAME

ccnpoke - Read data from stdin and send it as a single ContentObject in response to an interest. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnpoke* [-hflv] [-k 'keyuri'] [-p 'n'] [-t 'type'] [-V 'seg'] [-w 'timeout'] [-x 'freshness'] 'ccnxuri'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnpoke* utility reads data from stdin and generates a single ContentOjbect,
with attributes modfied by the given options, for the supplied CCNx
URI, 'ccnxuri', and sends that object in response to a matching interest.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
    Generate the help message.

*-e* 'file'::
    Populate the optional ExtOpt element with the contents of the given file.
    The provided data should generally  be ccnb encoded and limited in size,
    although ccnpeek does not enforce this.

*-f*::
    Force sending the ContentObject to ccnd even if there is no matching interest.
    This should be used only for testing purposes.
    
*-l*::
    Set the FinalBlockId based on the last component of the name.
    
*-v*::
    Report on stdout the name of the ContentObject written.

*-k* 'keyuri'::
    Specifies the name to be used in the KeyLocator of the ContentObject.

*-p* 'n'::
    Specifies the number of components of the URI that should be registered
    in the interest filter.  'n'=0 implies registering ccnx:/.  'n' must not
    be greater than the number of components in the name.  The default is to
    register the name as given, which will not include any derived version
    component implied by the *-V* option.

*-t* 'type'::
    Specifies the type to be encoded in the ContentObject.  Values are
    DATA (default), ENCR, GONE, KEY, LINK, NACK, as documented for ContentObjects.

*-V* 'seg'::
    Generate a version stamp, and use the specfied segment number as a suffix.
    If the segment number is "%00" then the FinalBlockId will also be set.

*-w* 'timeout'::
    Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, for an Interest to be received.
    
*-x* 'freshness'::
    Specifies the Freshness, in seconds, to be encoded in the ContentObject.    

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error, error sending ContentObject)

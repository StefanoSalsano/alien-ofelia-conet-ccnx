CCNDLIBTEST(1)
================

NAME
----
ccnlibtest - Run scripted tests of the ccnx C library.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnlibtest* [-h] [-v] ( 'command' | 'file.ccnb' ) '...'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnlibtest* program is for running scripted tests of the ccnx C library.

The basic behavior of ccnlibtest is to use ccn_connect() to connect to a ccnd,
and then to process its arguments, in order.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
     Print usage information and exit.

*-v*::
     Be more verbose.

ARGUMENTS
---------
The arguments are processed in order.

An argument ending in .ccnb is assumed to name a file that contains a single
ccnb-encoded Interest or ContentObject.
These files are read, and processed as follows:

A ContentObject is held in a local buffer pool.
When triggered by the arrival of a matching interest,
the ContentObject is sent, and also removed from the pool.
There are up to 10 buffer pools available,
and each buffer pool may contain up to 10 content objects.
Initially pool 0 is the active pool.

An Interest is sent via ccn_express_interest().
If and when a matching ContentObject arrives,
it will be placed into the pool that was active when the interest was sent.

*pool* 'digit'::
     Switch to the indicated buffer pool.

*prefix* 'ccnx:/uri'::
     Causes a prefix registration to happen, using the given name as the prefix.
     The registration is associated with the current buffer pool.

*flags* 'regflgs'::
     Use 'regflgs' as the flags for subsequent prefix registration.
     This should be expressed as a number.
     Refer to doc/technical/Registration for flag bits.

*run* 'millisec'::
    Run for the indicated number of milliseconds,
    or until the arrival of data.

*reconnect* 'secs'::
    Disconnect the ccn handle, sleep for 'secs' seconds and then reconnect.
    Used for testing disconnect/reconnect behavior.

*mincob* 'num'::
    Fail if the current pool has fewer than 'num' content objects.

*maxcob* 'num'::
    Fail if the current pool has more than 'num' content objects.

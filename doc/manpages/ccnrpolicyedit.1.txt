CCNRPOLICYEDIT(1)
================

NAME
----
ccnrpolicyedit - edit policy.xml

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnrpolicyedit*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnrpolicyedit* command provides a convenient way to edit the policy associated
with a repository instance.

The true repository policy is stored in a content object in the repo itself.
It is encoded in ccnb format,
which is not directly editable with the usual tools, such as a text editor.
To cope with this,
*ccnrpolicyedit* works by translating the ccnb form to a normal text-based
xml encoding in a temporary copy, calling a text editor on this copy, and 
then translating back to ccnb before storing the updated policy in the repo.

OPTIONS
-------
None.

ARGUMENTS
---------
None.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
The value of *CCNR_GLOBAL_PREFIX* controls the repository instance that is
to be configured.
The usual way to set this is by editing ~/.ccnx/ccndrc
The value of *EDITOR* may be used to specify what text editor should be
called to do the actual editing.  The default is *vi*.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*nonzero*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error, file not found)

FILES
-----
*$$~/.ccnx/ccnd.conf,  ~/.ccnx/ccndrc, ~/.ccnx/repository/config$$*

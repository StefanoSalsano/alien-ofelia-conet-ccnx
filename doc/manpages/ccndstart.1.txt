CCNDSTART(1)
============

NAME
----
ccndstart - Start ccnd in the background and set up forwarding according to configuration

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccndstart*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccndstart* utility starts ccnd in the background.
*ccndstart* looks for configuration of forwarding information in
'$HOME/.ccnx/ccnd.conf'; refer to *ccndc(1)* for the format.
If *ccnd* is already running, it will be shut down and restarted;
any manually-configured forwarding (with *ccndc*) will need to be re-executed.

*ccndstart* will start using default values for 'CCND_CAP', 'CCND_DEBUG' and
the default port 9695 for 'CCN_LOCAL_PORT'.  These environment values may
be set to change the cache size, *ccnd* debug logging, and port number, respectively.
The values may be set in '$HOME/.ccnx/ccndrc', which is sourced at startup.

OPTIONS
-------

This utility does not have have flags or arguments.

These environment variables are handled by *ccndstart*:

     CCND_LOG
     CCND_PRELOAD

'CCND_LOG' is the name of the log file.  If none is specified, the
log output appears on *stderr*.

'CCND_PRELOAD' is a list of file names for files containing ccnb-encoded
content objects.  These will be preloaded into the ccnd's cache at startup.
See *ccnrm(1)* for one way to make such a file.

If the environment variable 'CCNR_GLOBAL_PREFIX' is set, *ccndstart* will
also start an instance of the *ccnr* repository, using the directory
'$HOME/.ccnx/repository' to contain the backing files.
Additional configuration for this instance may be placed in the file
'$HOME/.ccnx/repository/config'.

Please see *ccnd(1)* and *ccnr(1)* for additional environment variables.

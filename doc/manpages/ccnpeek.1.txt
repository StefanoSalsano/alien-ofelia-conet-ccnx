OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
    Generate the help message.

*-a*::

    Content only, rather than the full ccnb encoded ContentObject, should be
    written to stdout.

*-l* 'lifetime'::
    Specifies the lifetime, in seconds, of the interest.  The lifetime is encoded

    propagate. A value of 0 limits it to the local *ccnd* cache, 1 to the

    with no scope specified, is unlimited forwarding.

*-u*::
    Allow unverified content to be returned.

*-v*::
    Resolve a version number prior to fetching the final ContentObject.

NAME
----
ccnc - a simple community text chat program

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnc* 'chatroomURI'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnc* utility is a text-based community chat program.

A "chat room" argument (a ccnx URI) is used to identify the channel.
All of the participants must use the same uri.

If standard input and standard output are both tty devices,
a simple line editor is provided.

As is the case for all ccnx applications, a ccnd must be running on each
machine, and suitable forwarding rules must be configured.
Please refer to *ccndstart(1)* and *ccndc(1)* for details.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
    Generate a brief help message and exit.

*-d*::
    Debug mode - no input editing.
    This is rarely needed, except when running under a debugger.

*-i* 'n'::
    Print n bytes of signer's public key digest in hex.
    This is the 'robot name'.
    The default is 3 (6 characters of hex).
    There is one space separating the robot name from the text of the message.
    Use 0 here to suppress the robot name (and the space), or 32 if
    you need to know the complete signer digest.

*-n*::
    No echo of own messages.

*-q*::
    Disable automatic greeting or farewell messages.
    (At present only the farewell message is implemented.)

*-r* 'command'::
    Operate using the specified command as an automatic responder.
    The command is executed using sh(1), with standard input
    receiving anything produced by peers on the chat channel,
    and standard output directed to the chat channel.
    Each line of output produces a separate message on the
    channel.
    The standard input and standard output that were passed
    to ccnc in this mode are unused, but standard error is
    available to the responder.
    For this mode, the effect of -dnq is automatically applied.
    Care should be taken to prevent an automatic responder
    from reacting in an uncontrolled fashion to another
    responder.
    It is wise to include rate limiting or an output cap,
    and remember the dictum
    "if you don't know what to say, say nothing."

*-v*::
    Verbose trace of what is happening, on standard output.

*-x* 'seconds'::
    Set the FreshnessSeconds in the content objects to the given value.
    The default is 1800 (1/2 hour).
    Ask for 0 to avoid setting freshness.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

*CCNX_DIR=_/path/to/identity/directory_*::
    If you wish to use an identity (public key) other than your default,
    create one and set CCNX_DIR before starting *ccnc*:
-------------------------------------------
mkdir -p /var/tmp/friendlyname
ccninitkeystore /var/tmp/friendlyname
export CCNX_DIR=/var/tmp/friendlyname/.ccnx
ccnc ccnx:/ccnx.org/chat
-------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES
--------
(see BUGS.)

BUGS
----
There is no implementation of "friendly names", as used by *ccnchat(1)*.
Instead, there is a display of a few leading hex digits
of the publisher public key digest (aka "robot name").
(Some may consider this a feature rather than a bug.)

There is inadequate notification if no other participants are present.
(Typed lines will simply appear to vanish.)

The diagnositics are too cryptic.

The man page has no examples.

Name Enumeration Protocol
=========================

== Basic Enumeration
The *Basic Enumeration (%C1.E.be)* command requests the first-level names under a specified prefix, much like a single-level directory listing command. It is constructed as an Interest with a name that is, when expressed as a URI, of the form

 ccnx:/<prefix>/%C1.E.be

=== *'<prefix>'*

*'<prefix>'* is required, is the prefix under which lower-level names are requested, and may have multiple components. See link:Name.html[CCNx Name Specification].


=== Response

If the object 'is' present, the Repository responds with the first segment of names immediately below the specified prefix. If the result does not fit in a single segment, the remaining segments may be fetched using the standard segmentation markers (`%00%01`, `%00%02`, â€¦) in place of the `%00`. If every component of the prefix exists in the Repository but there are no components below the last component of the prefix, then an empty collection is returned (i.e., "<collection/>").

If the object is 'not' present, the Repository does not respond.

For example, if you express the following interest:

[literal]
	ccnx:/xxx/yyy/%C1.E.be

then the first segment of the response will be named:

[literal]
	ccnx:/xxx/yyy/%C1.E.be/%C1.M.K%00<public_key_of_responding_repository>/%FD<version>/%00

and the content will be a Collection of Links (see link:xsd.html[ccnx.xsd]) of the following form:

[literal]
	<Collection>
	  <Link>
	    <Name>
	      <Component ccnbencoding="base64Binary">/QTuZqRyKQ==</Component>
	      <!--       %FD%04%EEf%A4r%29 -->
	    </Name>
	  </Link>
	</Collection>

where the query in this case was for a part of the namespace that happened to have exactly one component under it that looked like a version.

The protocol is illustrated below.

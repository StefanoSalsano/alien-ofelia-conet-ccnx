# This example test shows how to mark a test as long-running:
LongTest
# Tests like this are skipped if the user has asked for a shorter test run.
# At present, you can get the abbreviated tests by invoking "make check" instead of "make test"

# Here, we simply do a countdown:
i=10
while [ $i -gt 0 ]; do printf '%d ... ' $i >&2; sleep 1; i=$((i-1)); done
echo BLAST OFF >&2

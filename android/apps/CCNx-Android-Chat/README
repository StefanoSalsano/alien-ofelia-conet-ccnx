This is an Android UI to the CCNChatNet chat core.
The UI will automatically open a multicast socket, so please
make sure you have done something like:

	./ccndc add ccnx:/ udp 224.0.23.170 59695

on any non-Android systems you want to chat with.

RUNNING ON EMULATOR
===================

The emulator will not forward multicast to the host.  So, we need to use
point-to-point connections with port forwarding.

If you are running two or more devices/emulators at the same time, it is handy
to open one shell for each one and use "export ANDROID_SERIAL=..."  in each one
so you can "make install" and "adb logcat" easily.  You can see the available
serial numbers with "adb devices".

To run multiple emulators at the same time, you need to create multiple AVDs.
Be sure to add SD Card support to each one.

If you start an emulator from the commandline, you can use the option
"-qemu -redir tcp:x:9695" instead of the telnet commands below.

	emulator -avd avd1 -qemu -redir tcp:9696::9695

EXAMPLE:  Host ccnd as hub
=============================
- Host IP 13.2.116.104 
- Emulator #1 is on port 5554 running Avd "avd1"
- Emulator #2 is on port 5556 running Avd "avd2"

1) Start both emulators
2) Use the "CCNx Service Control" app to start the services on both
3) Start ccnd & a repo on your local host
4) redirect tcp/9996 to avd1
	telnet localhost 5554
	redir add tcp:9696:9695
	exit
5) redirect tcp/9997 to avd2
	telnet localhost 5556
	redir add tcp:9697:9695
	exit
6) Setup hub routes
	ccndc add ccnx:/ tcp 127.0.0.1 9696
	ccndc add ccnx:/ tcp 127.0.0.1 9697
7) Start chat app on avd1
	Handle "avd1"
	Remote host: 13.2.116.104 
	Remote port: 9695
8) Start chat app on avd1
	Handle "avd2"
	Remote host: 13.2.116.104 
	Remote port: 9695
9) Run chat on host too, everyone should be happy!
